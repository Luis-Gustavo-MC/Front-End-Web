            <p>The Offspring is an American rock band formed in Garden Grove, California, in 1984. Initially formed under the name Manic Subsidal, <span class="bold">the band currently consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Bryan "Dexter" Holland, lead guitarist Kevin "Noodles" Wasserman, bassist Todd Morse, multi-instrumentalist Jonah Nimoy, and drummer Brandon Pertzborn</span>. The Offspring is often credited (alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day, NOFX, Bad Religion, Rancid, and Pennywise) for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock during the mid-1990s. During their 41-year career, the Offspring has released eleven studio albums and sold more than 45 million records, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands.</p>
